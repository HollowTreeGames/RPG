Henry: There's a stream up ahead, in the East. We can make camp beside it for the night.
<<face Henry down>>
<<face Oakewood up>>
Henry: We'll have fresh water and a clear place to sleep!
<<face Oakewood down>>
Oakewood (silent): Ah--
Henry (concerned): Something wrong, Oakewood?
<<face Oakewood up>>
Oakewood: My joints are giving me guff, and that means a storm is coming. That stream is going to flood, I'm sure of it.
Oakewood: We'll camp out to the south by the pond here, in the trees.
Henry (concerned): Uh, I don't think that's a good idea... 
Henry (concerned): There are a lot of wild animals out here, and I've seen a few squirrels eyeing our food.
Oakewood: We can deal with a few squirrels. 
Henry (concerned) <wait=1; nopause; nocleartext>: It's not just squirrels! It's raccoons, and... 
Henry (concerned): and bears too!
Oakewood (angry): Pah! Bears. You're crazy.
Oakewood (angry): And it's still better than our whole camp getting swept away in a flood.
Henry (angry): The stream won't flood! It might get a little high, but—
Oakewood (angry): Wild animals can't tie us up and hold us for ransom—
Belfry (scared): Oh no, guys!

Belfry (scared): The travel fatigue is getting to us! We're starting to turn on each other.

Oakewood (annoyed): ... it looks like we're not going to come to an easy agreement.
Oakewood: Belfry, you must be the tiebreaker. If you're smart, and I know you are, then you'll pick the hill.
Henry: Before you side with Oakewood, at LEAST check out the area by the stream! It's elevated! I'm sure it'll be just fine!
Oakewood (annoyed): Poppycock! Tell me I'm wrong about the hill, Belfry, I dare you.
Belfry (determined): Don't worry! I'm going to make a super informed decision!

Henry (sad): I hate to say it, but... yeah...
