title: Oakewood Intro

<<wait scene>>
Henry: There's a stream up ahead, in the East. We can make camp beside it for the night. 
Henry: We'll have fresh water and a clear place to sleep!
Oakewood: Ah--
Henry: Something wrong, Oakewood?
Oakewood: My joints are giving me guff, and that means a storm is coming. That stream is going to flood, I'm sure of it.
Oakewood: We'll camp out farther up North, in the trees.
Henry: Uh, I don't think that's a good idea... There are a lot of wild animals out here, and I've seen a few squirrels eyeing our food.
Oakewood: We can deal with a few squirrels. 
Henry: It's not just squirrels! It's raccoons, and...
<pause>
<continue in same line> and bears too!
Oakewood: Pah! Bears. You're crazy.
Oakewood: And it's still better than our whole camp getting swept away in a flood.
Henry: The stream won't flood! It might get a little high, but—
Oakewood: Wild animals can't tie us up and hold us for ransom—
Belfry: Oh no, guys!
*Oakewood and Henry stop and look at Belfry.* 
Belfry: The travel fatigue is getting to us! We're starting to turn on each other.
*Oakewood and Henry look at each other.*
Oakewood: ... it looks like we're not going to come to an easy agreement.
Oakewood: Belfry, you must be the tiebreaker. If you're smart, and I know you are, then you'll pick the hill.
Henry: Before you side with Oakewood, at LEAST check out the area by the stream! It's elevated! I'm sure it'll be just fine!
Oakewood: Poppycock! Tell me I'm wrong about the hill, Belfry, I dare you.
Belfry: Don't worry! I'm going to make a super informed decision!
*Oakewood and Henry look at each other.*
Oakewood: We're doomed.
Henry: I hate to say it, but... yeah...
