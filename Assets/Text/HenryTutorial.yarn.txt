Henry (Sad):		That rock looks sad now.
Belfry (Sad):		Does it?
Henry (Sad):		Yes.
Henry:				Maybe you should apologize to it.
Belfry (Sad):		... to a rock?
Henry:				You know that friends come from the unlikeliest of places!
Belfry (Happy):		You're right, Henry. I'll talk to the rock.

Belfry (Happy):		Hi, Friend Rock! I'm so sorry I dropped you so hard, are you okay?
Rock:               ...
Belfry (Sad):       ...
Rock:               ...
Belfry:             Well... that's good, then.
Belfry:             So... how's it going? How's rock life?
Belfry:             Swell? I'll bet it's swell.
Rock:               ...
Belfry:             You know, it's probably nice being a rock. No one to boss you around.
Belfry:             Or tell you you're a screwup. 
Belfry (sad):       Or remind you that you burned down the whole town...
Rock:               ...
Belfry (sad):       Yeah, that sounds like quite the life.
Belfry (sad):       But I'm just trying my best to help! And now they act like they don't even want my help!
Belfry (sad):       What should I do, Friend Rock? Should I just keep trying or give up?
Rock:               ...
Belfry (happy):     You know what, you're right! Everyone screws up every now and then...
Belfry (happy):     But the important thing is that you keep trying!
Belfry (happy):     Thanks, Friend Rock! You've been a big help!
Rock:               ...
