title: Belfry Complains
---
Oakewood: Belfry, we need to pick up the pace if we want to find a good campsite before nightfall.
Belfry (tired): But we've been walking for daaaays! I'm soooo knackered...
Oakewood: We're all knackered, Belfry.
Henry (happy): I'm actually feeling alright!
<<face Oakewood right>>
Oakewood (angry): ...
<<face Oakewood left>>
Oakewood: Most of us are knackered, Belfry.
<<face Henry right>>
Oakewood: But even an old coyote like me can keep going when he needs to.
<<moveFor Henry right 0.5 5>>
Oakewood: A wee bat like you should be able to outpace me ten to one.
Belfry (mad): I'm not THAT wee, Oakewood!
Belfry (mad): I'm an adult, just like you and Henry!
Oakewood: Definitely not just like me.

Belfry (sad): I wish we could just go home.
Oakewood: We don't have a home to go back to. So we just need to keep looking.
Belfry (happy): Maybe one of the other groups have found a good spot already! We could go back and wait for them!
Oakewood: No. Everyone must work their hardest to find us all a new place to live. 
Oakewood: What if everyone went back and waited for someone else to do the hard work? We'd all be out in the cold, just waiting.
Belfry: Oh. That makes sense!
Oakewood: So can you walk for a few more hours?
Belfry (determined): Yeah! We don't want to leave everyone else in the cold, just waiting!

Oakewood: Good girl. Now let's catch up with Henry. You can rest later.
<<face Oakewood right>>
Henry: Hey, I found a good spot to camp!
Oakewood (angry): ...
Oakewood: ... *sigh*
Oakewood: Fine. Let's set up camp.
Belfry (happy): Hooray! We did it!
