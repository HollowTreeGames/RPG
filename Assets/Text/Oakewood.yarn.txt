Oakewood:		  As long as you're doing these ridiculous fetch quests, you might as well help me out.
Oakewood:	 	  As you well know, your last library book is overdue.
Oakewood (Happy): How long has it been?
Oakewood:		  Oh, right.
Oakewood (Sad):	  FIVE YEARS.
Oakewood:		  It's probably a pile of ashes after your last little stunt, so I'll tell you what.
Oakewood:		  Find me a new book, suitable for all ages, to start the new library.
Oakewood:		  Then I'll consider you off the hook.
Oakewood (Sad):	  For now.

Oakewood:		  I did say this book needs to be suitable for ALL AGES.
Oakewood:		  We don't want Piper learning to roll a blunt, now do we?
Oakewood (Sad):	  Don't answer that.

Oakewood:		  Fur... what now?
Oakewood (Sad):	  ...
Oakewood (Happy): It'll do, I suppose.

Oakewood:		  Belfry, that is a bud of marijuana.
Oakewood:		  I believe the strain is called "Alaskan Thunder Fuck."
Oakewood (Happy): Don't ask me how I know that.
Oakewood (Sad):	  Either way, it's not a book, you moron.
Oakewood (Sad):   Try again.

Oakewood:		  What...
Oakewood (Sad):	  I don't even know what this is.
Oakewood (Happy): Is it a mirror?
Oakewood (Sad):   Take it back. It angers me.
Oakewood (Sad):   And it's not a book!!

Oakewood:		  Have you found my new book yet?
Oakewood:		  Make sure it doesn't take you five years this time.

Oakewood (Sad):	  You have strange tastes in books.
Oakewood (Happy): But...
Oakewood:		  I appreciate the effort you put in.
Oakewood:		  One day the creatures of the former town of Treehollow might forgive you.
Oakewood (Sad):	  Just don't burn this new place down too.
